# self-revealing-dairy

Step 1: Set up the project structure

    Create a new React Native project using npx react-native init DailyDiary
    Create a new Spring Boot project using spring init --type=web --project-name=daily-diary-backend
    Create a new MongoDB database and collection for storing diary entries

Step 2: Design the database schema

    Define the MongoDB schema for diary entries:
        _id (ObjectId): unique identifier
        userId (String): user ID
        entryDate (Date): date of entry
        entryText (String): text of entry
        visibleToOtherUser (Boolean): flag to indicate visibility to other user

Step 3: Implement authentication and authorization

    Use Spring Security to implement authentication and authorization
    Create endpoints for user registration, login, and token refresh

Step 4: Implement diary entry API

    Create Spring Boot REST API endpoints for:
        Creating new diary entries
        Retrieving diary entries for a user
        Updating diary entries
        Deleting diary entries

Step 5: Implement delayed visibility logic

    Use a scheduling library (e.g., Quartz Scheduler) to schedule a task to update the visibleToOtherUser flag after 7 days

Step 6: Build the React Native frontend

    Use React Native to build the mobile app UI
    Implement authentication and authorization using the Spring Boot API
    Implement diary entry creation, retrieval, and display

Step 7: Host the web app

    Use a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku) to host the Spring Boot API
    Use a hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify) to host the React Native web app

Step 8: Test and deploy

    Test the web app thoroughly
    Deploy the web app to the hosting services
